## Frequently Asked Question

How do I know your trading algorithms are reliable and not just based on hypothetical results?

At Bitrader, we pride ourselves on transparency and
reliability. All our algorithms are cash tested for at least
24 months before being offered to clients. We use FXBlue, a
third-party verification website, to provide real-time,
live-updated results from actual trading accounts. This
ensures that all performance data is authentic and
verifiable. You can access these public links to see the
historical performance of our algorithms yourself.

Is my money safe? What level of risk is involved in using your trading algorithms?

Your funds remain entirely under your control in your brokerage account; we do not have access to your money. Our algorithms are designed to minimize risk, with a maximum historical drawdown of only 15.58% Over a 12 year period, which is significantly lower than the industry standard of 30-37%. We constantly update our algorithms to adapt to market changes, further ensuring the safety and performance of your investments.

Why should I trust your algorithms over others on the market?

Our algorithms stand out because they are built on over a decade of market data and professional trading experience. We have been running our flagship algorithm since 2012 and have a proven track record of consistent monthly returns between 8-15%. Additionally, we trade only three statistically significant and negatively correlated currency pairs, which helps mitigate risk and enhance performance. Our 75% win rate further showcases the reliability and success of our strategies.

What kind of support and resources will I have access to if I become a client?

At Bitrader, we believe in providing comprehensive support to our clients. Each client gets a dedicated personal account manager to assist with any questions or issues. Additionally, our support team is available to help you navigate our algorithms and ensure you get the most out of our services. We also provide access to detailed performance reports and real-time data to keep you informed about your investments.

How do your algorithms handle market volatility and sudden economic changes?

Our algorithms are designed to be adaptive and responsive to market conditions. We have an in-house team of quants who constantly update the algorithms based on real-time market data, news, and geopolitical events. This continuous improvement process ensures that our algorithms can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks associated with market volatility and sudden economic changes.

Can I still manually trade or intervene with the algorithm's decisions?

While our algorithms are designed to operate autonomously, providing 24/5 trading without manual intervention, you always have the final say. You can monitor all trading activities in real-time and intervene if you feel necessary. However, our system is optimized for automated performance, and manual interventions might affect the overall efficiency and results of the algorithm.

**Disclaimer:** Trading involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. The high level of leverage can work both for and against
traders. Before trading, consider your investment objectives, experience level, and risk
tolerance. You could lose some or all of your initial investment; do not invest money
that you cannot afford to lose. Educate yourself on the risks associated with trading
and seek advice from an independent financial or tax advisor if you have
questions.Performance data for the Quantum AI Alpha and other algorithms represents past
performance, which is not a reliable indicator of future results. No representation is
made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those
shown. **Risk Warning**: Investing in forex,
stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities involves significant risk and may not be
suitable for all investors. Trading may result in the loss of your capital. Required

Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations. Unlike actual
performance records, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the

benefit of hindsight. **No Guarantee of Results**:
Bitrader makes no guarantees of profit or avoidance of losses when trading.
Hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record
can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.
